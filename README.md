Summary
=======

Controlling your iRobot Create should be fun, sleek, and accessible from all of your devices that have a web browser!

Just mount a laptop with a webcam on your iRobot Create, connect it to the serial port, install this project as a windows service (installutil.exe /i dotjosh.irobot.server.exe) and connect to the web ui that's hosted in-process on port 6687 (e.g. http://yourlaptop:6687).

* Full keyboard driving support (like a video game) in the browser, just use your arrow keys.
* Clean, modern, 100% HTML/JS UI built right in or you can use the exposed JSON API and make your own!

This project is very much still a work in progress, any help is always appreciated.

Summary
=======

Controlling your iRobot Create should be fun, sleek, and accessible from all of your devices that have a web browser!

Just mount a laptop with a webcam on your iRobot Create, connect it to the serial port, install this project as a windows service (from a command line run: dotjosh.irobot.server.exe install) and connect to the web ui that's hosted in-process on port 6687 (e.g. http://yourlaptop:6687).

* Full keyboard driving support (like a video game) in the browser, just use your arrow keys.
* Clean, modern, 100% HTML/JS UI built right in or you can use the exposed JSON API and make your own!
* Serial command/sensor communication is abstracted into it's own project that can be used for your own .net application.

This project is still a work in progress, contributions are encourage appreciated.
